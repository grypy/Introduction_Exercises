Write a program that computes the amount of gas in moles when the user supplies
the pressure, volume and temperature. Test your program by determining the number
of moles of gas in a SCUBA tank. A typical SCUBA tank holds 12 liters of gas at
a pressure of 20,000,000 Pascals (approximately 3,000 PSI). Room temperature is
approximately 20 degrees Celsius or 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
