In the United States, fuel efficiency for vehicles is normally expressed in 
miles-per gallon (MPG). In Canada, fuel efficiency is normally expressed in
 liters-per-hundred kilometers (L/100 km). 
 Use your research skills to determine how to convert from
MPG to L/100 km. Then create a program that reads a value from the user in American
units and displays the equivalent fuel efficiency in Canadian units
